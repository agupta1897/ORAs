The wild scene dataset contains approximately 101 image tripletes taken from different scenes. 

In "witgt" folder, we provide the groundtruth for the mixture images. 

In "withoutgt" folder, we only provide the mixture images. 

If you want to evaluet the performance of your methods on this part, you can follow the following steps:

1) Put your results in the corresponding folder 
2) Name your results using the corresponding forlder names.
3) Send your results to us and we will evaluate the performances for you.  


We try our best to reduce the misalignment caused by the refractive effect. However, you can still observe some misalignment in some image triplets (eg,30 34 36 27 28 29 85 1 2 in the withgt folder.)
